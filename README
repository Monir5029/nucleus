- Install sparsehash library to compile the code, https://code.google.com/p/sparsehash/.
- Edit makefile to point to sparsehash library
- './make' to compile
- './nucleus <graph> <algorithm> <hierarchy?>" to run;
		 <graph> is the input graph in matrix market or chaco format,
		 <algorithm> can be '12 (k-core), 13, 14, 23 (k-truss) or 34',
		 <hierarchy> is 1 to get the hierarchy, subgraphs and densities; 0 gets only K values

- When <hierarchy> is 1, there are 3 output files
		- <graph>_<algorithm>-Hierarchy: Runtimes, statistics and significantly dense subgraphs
		- <graph>_<algorithm>_NUCLEI: Each line is a nucleus, first 6 numbers are subgraph id, K value, |V|, |E|, edge densityand 1 (0) if the nucleus is (not) a leaf in the hierarchy
		- <graph>_<algorithm>_circle.json: Visualization file given to vis.sh -- ./vis.sh <graph>_<algorithm>_circle.json visualizes the hierarchy if you have use OSX and online


- In the *-Hierarchy file, "7: K: 1 |V|: 112 |E|: 425 ed: 0.06837 pr: 49 (LEAF)" means the nucleus with id 7 has K value of 1, and it has 112 vertices, 425 edges with 0.06837 edge density. It's a leaf in the hierarchy and its parent is the nucleus with the id of 49.
