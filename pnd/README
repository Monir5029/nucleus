- 'make' to compile

- OMP_NUM_THREADS=X './pnd <graph> <algorithm>' to run;
		 <graph> is the input graph in matrix market (.mtx) [1] or edge list (SNAP) [2] format. It can be a binary file as well (See [3])
		 <algorithm> can be X, X0 or X00 for X is 12, 23 or 34. X runs sequential peeling algorithm, X0 runs parallel local algorithm without notification mechanism, and X00 is for the most efficient parallel algorithm that uses notification mechanism (See citations below for details)

- Example: "OMP_NUM_THREADS=16 ./pnd adjnoun.mtx 2300" does most efficient parallel truss decomposition (with notification mechanism) with 16 threads

- To get the K values of vertices/edges, compile with 'K_VALUES=yes make'

[1] Matrix market has ".txt" or ".mtx" suffix. Its format for a 4 clique:
% First line is |V|, |E|
4 6
0 1
0 2
0 3
1 2
1 3
2 3

[2] SNAP format has "out." prefix. Its format for a 4 clique:

0 1
0 2
0 3
1 2
1 3
2 3

[3] Activate WRITE_BINARY macro in graph.cpp to write binary graph files with ".bin" suffix -- recommended for large graphs
