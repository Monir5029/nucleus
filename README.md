This is a collection of the codes on the nucleus decomposition framework.
- 'nd' has the basic nucleus decomposition[1] and hierarchy construction[2] codes.
- 'bnd' has the tip and wing decompositions for bipartite networks[3] along with the hierarchy contructions
- 'pnd' has the parallel nucleus decomposition algorithms[4], based on the h-index formulation -- no hierarchy construction exists
- 'dnd' has the directed 2,3 nucleus decomposition algorithms
